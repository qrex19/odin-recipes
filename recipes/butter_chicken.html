    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tender and juicy chicken thanks to a deliciously spiced yogurt <br />
      marinade, Butter Chicken is ridiculously easy to make. The curry <br />
      sauce is out of this world! <br />
      I know you all love food with beautiful, bold flavours, and nothing <br />
      beats sitting down to a good great curry to finish off a chaotic day.
      <br />
      The aromas alone transport you to a completely different world. <br />
      The best part about cooking up Butter Chicken at home is the <br />
      ingredients list. Every ingredient is easy to find from any grocery <br />
      store or supermarket.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into
        bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger (or finely grated)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. <br />
          (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the
          <br />
          pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too <br />
          many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of <br />
          them if you wish. <br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
    </ol>
